# Evades Bingo
Made by Br1h

# What is this
Bingo in games generally refers to getting a 5x5 grid board of goals. Your aim is to complete a line of goals better than your opposing team. For the evades implementation the goals are currently only try to complete a map (more in future if this picks up).

# Rules
You cannot submit a run with less than 40 seconds                                               
You cannot submit a run that has less than 5 areas

The script or server will just reject the run if rules aren't followed.

# Connecting the script 

If you would like to use the script there are 2 ways to use it.
The direct link for the code is [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tronicality/Evades-Bingo/refs/heads/main/client.js) (you can just copy all of it with ctrl/cmd + a -> ctrl/cmd + c)

First method is to paste all of it into your console (for example if you are on chrome you can press f12 to access it) while on evades.io. The problem with this method is that you would need to paste it every time you refresh the page.

Second method is to get the web extension Tampermonkey. The you can paste all of it there, turn on updates and it will auto-update and apply the code everytime you refresh (Don't forget to turn on developer mode for tampermonkey otherwise it will not work within your web browser settings).

If there's any errors you can open an issue or contact me on discord (.realityy)
