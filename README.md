# Connecting the script 

If you would like to use the script there are 2 ways to use it.
The direct link for the code is https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tronicality/Evades-Bingo/refs/heads/main/script.js (you can just copy all of it with ctrl/cmd + a -> ctrl/cmd + c)

First method is to paste all of it into your console (for example if you are on chrome you can press f12 to access it) while on evades.io. The problem with this method is that you would need to paste it every time you refresh the page.

Second method is to get the web extension Tampermonkey. The you can paste all of it there, turn on updates and it will auto-update and apply the code everytime you refresh (Don't forget to turn on developer mode for tampermonkey otherwise it will not work within your web browser settings).

If there's any errors you can open an issue or contact me on discord (.realityy)
